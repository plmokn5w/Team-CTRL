## Developer Survival 💻🎮

    Have you ever felt like the process of fixing a bug in a program was like a game?

    We started making this game out of this idea.

    It also means that we will become great programmers 
    by improving our programming language proficiency.

### 1. How did you make this project?

    The game was created using Python and Pygame.

    The website is based on Hugo.

    Also, it contains the efforts of jukanmi, highlees, khb7 and plmokn5w.


### 2. How do I play it?

    It's a game operated by a direction key.

    Think about the meaning of the game and learn how to operate it. 

    This is it. It's easy! 😃

### 3. Where can I download this game?

    You can download it from our Github!
